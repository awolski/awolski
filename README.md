### Hi there üëã

I'm Tony Wolski.

I'm currently working on building a **climate-focused tech co-operative** üå± **[Yvant](https://yvant.coop)** üå± that I co-founded in 2022.

> **Yvant** builds **systems** to help solve the climate crisis. We **collaborate** with organisations who share our drive to create a thriving environment for future generations.

Together with [Ethel Mendez Castillo](https://www.ethelmendezcastillo.com/) and [Iv√°n Perdomo](https://perdomo.me) we're building an organisation where people can make a *difference* while making a *living*.

If you're aware of any climate related projects or programs that need help with software design, development, DevOps, infrastructure as code (IaC), cloud computing, automation... or anything tech-related, please feel free to drop us a line at [hello@yvant.coop](mailto:hello@yvant.coop).

And me...

I work as a **DevOps** and **software engineer**. I have 20 years experience in systems design, development, continuous integration and deployment, cloud transformation, automation, and infrastructure as code. I've worked in Australia, US, Spain and UK, in small and large organisations, startups and established companies, health, insurance, aviation, finance.
